##exercise_1
##for x=3 and y=15, compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient of x and y
x <- 3
y <- 15
x + y
x - y
x * y
x / y

##exercise_2
##for x=2 and y=3, Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value
x <- 2; y <- 3
x^5 > y^4

##exercise_3
##create a vector of the values 22,62,148,43 and 129.
##determine the sum of the vector.
##divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine related frequency
x <- c(22,62,148,43,129)
sum (x)
x / 404

##exercise_4
##create a vector of the nucleotides A,T,C and G. Sort the vector.
nucleotides <- c("A","T","C","G")
sort(nucleotides)

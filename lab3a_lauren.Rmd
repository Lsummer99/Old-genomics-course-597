## Starting with the Data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

## Inspecting data.frame objects
## Size
```{r}

```

## Content
```{r}

```

## Names
```{r}

## Summary
```{r}
str(surveys)
summary(surveys)
```

## Challenge 1: Based on the output of str(surveys), can you answer the following questions?

## What is the class of the object surveys?
## -Answer: data.frame
## How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
## - Answer: 34786 rows and 12 collumns
## How many species have been recorded during these surveys?
## Answer: 48 Note: You permitted me to skip this part because I cannot produce the normal results. The results I got from the summary(survey) command was the one I would have gotten if I used Tidyverse. 



## Indexing and Subsetting Data Frames

# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
```{r}
surveys[1, 1]
```

# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
```{r}
surveys[1, 6]
```

# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
```{r}
surveys[, 1] 
```

# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
```{r}
surveys[1]
```

# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
```{r}
surveys[1:3, 7]
```

# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
```{r}
surveys[3, ]  
```

# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
```{r}
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] 
```

```{r}
1:10
10:1
surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

```{r}
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```



## Challenge 2

## 1. Create a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.

```{r}
surveys_200 <- surveys[200,]
```

## 2. Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? Use that number (34786) to pull out just that last row in the data frame.Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure itâ€™s meeting expectations.Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.

```{r}
nrow(surveys)

surveys[34786,]

tail(surveys)

nrow(surveys_last)

```

## 3. Create a new data frame (surveys_last) from that last row.
```{r}
surveys_last <- surveys[34786,]
```

## 4. Use nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named surveys_middle.
```{r}

surveys[17393,]

surveys_middle <- surveys[17393,]
```


## 5. Combine nrow() with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of head(surveys), keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

##how to combine nrow() with anything because nrow will only produce a number...not contents 


```{r}
head(surveys)

surveys[-(7:34786),]
```


## Factors
```{r}
sex <- factor(c("male","female","female","male"))
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
sex
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex
```

```{r}
as.character(sex)
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct))

```

```{r}
plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))
sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
head(sex)
levels(sex)
```


```{r}
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
levels(sex)
```


##Chalenge 3
## 1.)
```{r}
levels(sex)[2] <- "female"
levels(sex)[3] <- "male"
levels(sex)
plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))
```

## 2.)
```{r}
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
levels(sex)
plot(sex)
```

##Using stringAsFactors = False
## Compare the difference between our data read as factor vs character.
```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
```

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
```

## Convert the column "plot_type" into a factor
```{r}
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
```

```{r}
animal_data <- data.frame(animal = c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"), feel = c("furry", "squishy", "spiny"), weight = c(45, 8 , 1.1, 0.8))
```




##Challenge 4: Find the mistakes in this hand crafted data
```{r}
animal_data <- data.frame(
          animal = c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
          feel = c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
          weight = c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8)
          )
```



##Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example? Check your guesses using str(country_climate):
##    Character, Character, Number, Logistical, Logistical

##Are they what you expected? Why? Why not?
##     They werent as expected because of the errors in the data. 

##What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the accurate data type?
```{r}
country_climate <- data.frame(
       country = c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
       climate = c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
       temperature = c(10, 30, 18, "15"),
       northern_hemisphere = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),
       has_kangaroo = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1)
       )
```

## After a few changes, the columns had the accurate data type

```{r}
country_climate <- data.frame(
       country = c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
       climate = c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
       temperature = c(10, 30, 18, 15),
       northern_hemisphere = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
       has_kangaroo = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
       )

str(country_climate)

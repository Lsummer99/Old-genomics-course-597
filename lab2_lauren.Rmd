```

Application written in R [@RCoreTeam] using the Shiny framework [@Chang2015].


## exercise_1 :)
## for x=3 and y=15, compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient of x and y

```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 15
x + y
x - y
x * y
x / y
```



## exercise_2
## for x=2 and y=3, Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value

```{r}
x <- 2; y <- 3
x^5 > y^4
```



## exercise_3
## create a vector of the values 22,62,148,43 and 129.
## determine the sum of the vector.
## divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine related frequency

```{r}
x <- c(22,62,148,43,129)
sum (x)
x / 404
```



## exercise_4
## create a vector of the nucleotides A,T,C and G. Sort the vector.

```{r}
nucleotides <- c("A","T","C","G")
sort(nucleotides)
```
